Q: What strategies is the hospital taking to prevent infections?
A: The hospital's hygiene management is based on the German Infection Protection Act and the guidelines for hospital hygiene and infection prevention, which are published and continuously updated by the Robert Koch Institute for Germany. The Clinical Microbiology and Hospital Hygiene Unit is responsible for creating the essential organizational and structural prerequisites so that employees can perceive and implement all infection prevention and control measures. These include, for example, measures to break chains of infection (such as hand hygiene, isolation, and disinfection measures), surveillance, the proper reprocessing of medical devices, and the controlled and appropriate perioperative and therapeutic use of antibiotics. The hygiene plan is continuously reviewed and updated.
